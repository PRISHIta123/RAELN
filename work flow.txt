Multi-class classification of malware log files

1. Log files, type of malware should be obtained through sand box 
2. Create a csv file to contain paths to the log files
3. Divide log files into training, validation and testing data
4. Feature extraction of training log files through RNN+LSTM and PCA
5. One-hot encoding the labels
6. Enhancing features and conversion to type accepted by classifier
7. Classification for type of malware: CNN and one of (OPF, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, K-nearest neighbours)
8. Training each model(4 combinations) using the data
9. Test the model's performance on testing dataset
10. Validate with labelled files and search for techniques (F1 score, K-fold cross validation) to handle true positives, fn, etc
11. Get the accuracy, plot graphs and analyze which model is best suited
