Multi-class classification of malware log files

1. Log files, type of malware should be obtained through sand box 
  VBS.NoMercy.B (virus binary files)
  Trojan.NSIS.Win32 (trojan binary files)
  Net-Worm.Win32.Kido (worm binary files)
  Android.Spy.49_iBanking_Feb2014 (spyware binary files)
  Ransomware.Satana (ransomware binary files)

2. Create a csv file to contain paths to the log files and labels
3. One-hot encoding the labels
4. Divide files into training, validation and testing data
5. Feature extraction of training log files through RNN+LSTM and PCA
6. Enhancing features and conversion to type accepted by classifier
7. Classification for type of malware: CNN and one of (OPF, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, K-nearest neighbours)
8. Training each model(4 combinations) using the data
9. Test the model's performance on testing dataset
10. Validate with labelled files and search for techniques (F1 score, K-fold cross validation) to handle true positives, fn, etc
11. Get the accuracy, plot graphs and analyze which model is best suited
