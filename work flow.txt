Multi-class classification of malware log files

1. Download training and testing csv files from https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/
2. Preprocessing the data
3. One-hot encoding the labels
4. Feature selection of training data through GRU-Auto Encoder and PCA
5. Enhancing features and conversion to type accepted by classifier
6. Classification for type of malware: Deep Belief Networks and DBSCAN algorithms
7. Training each model(4 combinations) using the data
8. Test the model's performance on testing dataset
9. Validate with labeled files and search for techniques (F1 score, K-fold cross validation) to handle true positives, fn, etc
10. Get the accuracy, plot graphs and analyze which model is best suited
