Multi-class classification

1. Log files, type of malware should be obtained through sand box and create dataset
2. Feature extraction of log files through RNN+LSTM and PCA
3. Enhancing features and conversion to type accepted by classifier
4. Classification for type of malware: CNN and one of (OPF, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, K-nearest neighbours)
5. Training the each model(4) using the data
6. Validate with labelled files and search for techniques (F1 score, K-fold cross validation) to handle true positives, fn, etc
7. Get the accuracy, plot graphs and analyze which model is best suited
