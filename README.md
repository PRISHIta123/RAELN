## Installation  

In order to support tensorflow v1.5, your local system should have a Python version <=3.5 installed, with the installation directory added to your PATH.  

Clone the project repository by downloading the zip file or using: ```git clone https://github.com/PRISHIta123/Malware_Classification_using_ML```  

Create a virtual environment to run the project using virtualenv (see this [link](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/) for installing virtualenv): ```virtualenv -p /path/to/Python3.5/python.exe env ```  

Open a command prompt/terminal, navigate to the folder containing the cloned repository and use these commanda to activate the virtual environment.  
For Windows Users: ```\env\Scripts\Activate```  
For Mac OS/Linux Users: ```source /env/Scripts/Activate ```  

Install the project dependencies using: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
