Types of malware- Trojan, Virus, Rookit, Worm, Spyware

Multi-Class classification -image processing

Precision Recall- KNN

Collection of datasets- above types and benign (Virus Share, Maltrieve, Malicia Project, Anubis, virology.info)- static, Cuckoo Sandbox- dynamic/behaviour

Signature or Opcode frequency based?- polymorphism technology can fool, so behaviour-based techniques (static or dynamic analysis)?

Static analysis- Inspection on File Format, Extraction of Strings, Fingerprinting technique, Scanning with Anti-Virus, Disassembly method
  gives better accuracy

Other static attributes- Portable Executable, String sequences, Sequence of bytes

Should VMs be used

Dynamic Analysis (behaviour-based): See pdf

type of features needed (based on F1 and F2 scores)- debug size,  image version, debugRVA, ExportSize, ResourceSize, VirtualSize2, NumberOfSections - Windows-based VirusShare database

feature extraction-  gray-scale images, Opcode n-gram, and import function to extract the malware features

handling false positives (should test and train data have labels?)

how to handle overfitting (dropout)

Feature reduction (autoencoders, validation threshold)- handled above?

Cross-Validation Requirement- train and test data

CNNs, RNN + LSTMs or automate classification algorithms (OPF, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, K-nearest neighbours) or image  processing method (converting binary executable to pixelized image, GIST, PHOG)

RNN-feature extraction, CNN-classification -check method in pdf - Time consuming
